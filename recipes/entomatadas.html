    <p>A classic Mexican dish, consisting in tortillas dipped/smothered 
        in a tomato and chile sauce. Recipe calls for chicken, but it
        is optional. Serves two.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 kg of tortilla</li>
        <li>1/2 of a chicken breast</li>
        <li>1/2 an onion</li>
        <li>4 tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 sprig of epazote</li>
        <li>1 avocado</li>
        <li>Fresh chiles (al gusto)</li>
        <li>1/4 kg of queso panela</li>
        <li>A nub of butter</li>
        <li>A pinch of chicken boullion powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring chiles and tomatoes to a boil, leave boiling 
            until thoroughly cooked. (~10 minutes)</li>
        <li>Add chicken to separate pot of boiling water, with
            a smashed garlic clove and some onion for taste.</li>
        <li>Once the chiles and tomatoes are cooked, empty them
            into a blender with a little bit of water, a few slices
            of onion, and a dash of chicken boullion powder. Blend
            thoroughly.</li>
        <li>In a deep skillet heat enough oil to thinly cover the 
            bottom. Once shimmering, empty the contents of the blender.
            Cook on medium heat until tomato flavor develops (~6
            minutes.</li>
        <li>
            In the meantime,
            <ul>
                <li>Fry desired number of tortillas in butter until 
                    cooked but not crispy.</li>
                <li>Shred chicken breast.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>Throw the sprig of epazote into the sauce and stir. Remove 
            sooner for less epazote flavor and later for more.</li>
        <li>Roll chicken into tortillas, serve on plate, and 
            cover in sauce.</li>
        <li>Top with avocado and cheese. (Try raw onion, cream, 
            or parsley as well</li>
    </ol>
